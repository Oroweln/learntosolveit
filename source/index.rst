Learn, Understand and Solve Problems
------------------------------------

This website will help you learn programming languages such as **C** and
**Python**. It will help you become familiar with small programs, which are
often the building blocks of large solutions.

The key philosophy behind this project was.

* Small but complete.
* Practice is the key.

I recommend https://exercism.org as the platform to learn Programming and
practice with a dedicated community.

**Reference Books**

* C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie.

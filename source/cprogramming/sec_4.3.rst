Explanation
===========

This program has number of helper functions like `getop`, `push` and `pop`,
which we use to the implement the reverse polish notation calculator.

The function `getop` takes a string and determines if it is number. If it is a
number, both integer or decimal, it will store that number in the array and
return a flag `NUMBER` which states that number is found. It will push that
number to the stack. If it getop returns an operator like `+`, `-`, `*` or `/`,
it will `pop` two numbers out of the stack and operate on it. When it encounters
a `/`, it ensures that the second operand is not 0 and disallows.

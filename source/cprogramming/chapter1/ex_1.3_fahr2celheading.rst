Exercise 1.3 - Temperature Convertor
====================================

Question
--------


Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table.


Solution
--------

.. literalinclude:: ../../languages/cprogs/Ex_1.3_fahr2celheading.c
   :language: c
   :tab-width: 4

.. runcode:: ../../languages/cprogs/Ex_1.3_fahr2celheading.c
   :language: c
   :codesite: ideone


Explanation
===========

In this program we are going to convert a given Fahrenheit temperature to
Celsius temperature using the formula C=(5/9)(F-32) To do this we declare some
variables in the beginning of the program so that they can be used in the later
stages of the program. The variables in this program are: lower,upper,step,
celsius,fahr. The variable lower is assigned the value 0 similarly upper to 300,
step to 20, and fahr to lower. So when the program enters the while loop it
checks whether fahr <= upper is true, if it is true then it assigns the variable
celsius 5 * (fahr - 32) / 9 and then it prints output.

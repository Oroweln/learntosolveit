========

Demonstrate buffered and unbuffered getchar using the system read function.

.. runcode:: ../../languages/cprogs/sec_8.2_getchar.c

Explanation
===========

The un-buffered getchar, uses the system read and stores each character that is read in a character, c
and returns the character `return (read(0, &c, 1) == 1) ? (unsigned char) c : EOF;`

The buffered version of getchar, sets aside a buffer for reading the characters.

::

   static char buf[BUFSIZ];
   static char *bufp = buf;
   
And reads each of the characters into the buffer, `read(0, buf, sizeof buf)` and then returns one character at a 
time from the buffer.

The later would be more efficient than the former one.

To execute this program, give the input in the following manner.
    

::

   stdin
   this is buffered getchar x
   this is unbuffered getchar x
   
   stdout
   
   this is buffered getchar 
   this is unbuffered getchar
